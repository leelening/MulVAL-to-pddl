# MULVALTOPDDL

This is a small tool I develop to convert a logic attack graph to PDDL files describing the attacking procedure.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

#### MulVAL
* Visit http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~xou/mulval/ to download the latest MulVAL.

#### Python 3.x

* Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download the latest suitable Python 3.x version according to your OS (we used Python 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.04)

#### PDDL
Visit http://editor.planning.domains/ to solve the problem. Once you have **domain.pddl** and **problem.pddl**

### Installing

The following Python packages are required:

1. pandas
   
You can run the following command to install the package.
```
pip install pandas
```

You can download the tool using the following command. 

```
git clone https://github.com/leelening/MulVALTOPDDL.git
```

## Running the example

We provide an running example in the package. You can find AttackGraph.dot, ARCS.CSV, and VERTICES.CSV in the package. These files are generated by the [MulVAL](http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~xou/mulval/).

You can create a domain file **domain.pddl** by running the following command.
```
python create_domain.py ./example/VERTICES.CSV ./example/ARCS.CSV
```

Then you can create a problem file **problem.pddl** by running the following command.
```
python create_prob.py ./example/VERTICES.CSV
```

Once you get these two files: **domain.pddl** and **problem.pddl**. You can go to [PDDL Editor](http://editor.planning.domains/) to solve your planning problem. This online editor has many good features.
